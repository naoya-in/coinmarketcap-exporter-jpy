# coinmarketcap-pro-exporter
Forked from https://github.com/bonovoxly/coinmarketcap-exporter

A prometheus exporter for https://pro.coinmarketcap.com/.  
Provides Prometheus metrics from the [`Quotes Latest API`](https://pro.coinmarketcap.com/api/v1#operation/getV1CryptocurrencyQuotesLatest) of CoinMarketCap, such as US price, Bitcoin price, etc.

## Setup
1. Get your CoinMarketCap API KEY.  
https://pro.coinmarketcap.com/signup/
2. Please check all the necessary CoinMarketCap Currency IDs.  
[Standards and Conventions](https://pro.coinmarketcap.com/api/v1#section/Standards-and-Conventions)  
For a current list of supported cryptocurrencies use the `/cryptocurrency/map` API call.

    Example:  

    | Currency | CoinMarketCap ID |
    |---|---|
    | Bitcoin | 1 |
    | Ethereum | 1027 |
    | United States Dollar ($) | 2781 |
    | Japanese Yen (Â¥) | 2797 |

3. Run docker container while listening on localhost:9100:
    ```
    docker build -t coinmarketcap-pro-exporter:latest .

    docker run -e API_KEY=[ CoinMarketCap APIKEY] -e CoinID=[ID1,ID2,ID3...] -p 127.0.0.1:9101:9101 coinmarketcap-pro-exporter:latest
    ```
    or pull image from docker-hub
    ```
    docker run -e API_KEY=[CoinMarketCap APIKEY] -e CoinID=[ID1,ID2,ID3...] -p 9101:9101 naoyain/coinmarketcap-pro-exporter
    ```
